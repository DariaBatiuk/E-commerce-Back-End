## Description
This particular e-commerce application was created utilizing a starter code to establish a back-end system for an e-commerce website. It incorporates the command line interface (CLI) and object-relational mapping to execute various techniques for managing, storing, and retrieving data using HTTP methods through a RESTful API. To construct a back end for a shop's website, Express.js API is utilized, which interacts with a MySQL database using Sequelize.
